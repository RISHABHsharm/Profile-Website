                <div>Hi,</div>
                <div class= para>   
                    My name is Rishabh Sharma. Iâ€™m Freelance Web and Mobile Developer having an 
                    experience of about 1 year. With the help of my knowledge I want to develope 
                    interactive and user friendly websites and mobile apps. I also have Machine 
                    Learning experience to help people grow their bussiness and reduce their 
                    expenses.
                </div>
                <div class= para>
                    At first during my college time I was interested in Machine Learning because 
                    it facinates me to see how computer predicts complex results based on the data, 
                    but during my final year of B.E. (Computer Science) I have to learn web and 
                    mobile development and I fell in love with it because it allows me to interact 
                    with other people and understand them.
                </div>
                <div class= para>
                    So, now I have become a full - time software developer who help people show 
                    their ideas and bussiness all around the world with websites & apps, and also 
                    help their bussiness grow with my machine learning knowledge.  I have also 
                    started designing websites and apps which help me to build interactive and 
                    user friendly websites and apps.
